# Third Assignment
> <p> 
  At first, I have made few changes to the `spain` data frame and made up a few
new ones that i will frequently visit to answer the following questions.

<p> 
  Now, I will proceed to answer the following questions 
by making slight changes to the data frames mentioned above.
</p>

## Q1: Total number of wins for each champion

<p> 
  Having the `laliga_fullseason` data frame, I only need to chose the teams
that ranked first in each season, group the data frame by those teams, and
arrange them based on total number of wins.
</p>

```{r}
laliga_fullseason %>%
  filter(rank == 1) %>%
  group_by(team) %>%
  summarise(totwins = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(totwins)) -> laliga_winners

laliga_winners$team <- factor(laliga_winners$team, levels=laliga_winners$team[order(laliga_winners$totwins)])
```

> <p> 
  ggplot2:
</p>

```{r}
ggplot(data = laliga_winners, aes(x = team, y = totwins)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = team)) +  
  geom_label(aes(label = paste("Number of wins:", totwins), color = team), 
            size = 2, fontface = "bold.italic") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1)) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = 4) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 4)
```

```{r}

laliga_winners %>%
hchart(type = "column",
       hcaes(x = team, y = totwins),

  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Number of Title Wins")) %>%
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Clubs"), 
           opposite = TRUE,

  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_google())

```

## Q2: The Most Boring League Seasons and Teams


### The Most Boring League Seasons

<p>
  I've summarised each season with three colomns:
    1. number of total goals = A
    2. number of games with no goals in halftime = B
    3. number of games with 0-0 final results = C
    4. number of games with 1-1 final results = D
  I've computet the boringness of each league by this equation: 
  
  
  $$boringness = \frac{10 * C + 7 * B + 5 * D - A}{10}$$
  <br> <br> 
  
  
  
  Afterwards, I sort them in descending order based of this value.
</p>
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(stringr)
as.tbl(spain) %>%
  mutate(totGF = hgoal + vgoal, 
         totGH = as.numeric(str_sub(HT, start = 1, end = 1)) + 
           as.numeric(str_sub(HT, start = 3, end = 3)), 
         FHdif = totGF - totGH) %>%
  group_by(Season) %>%
  summarise(goal = sum(totGF) / n(), 
            nogoal = sum(hgoal + vgoal == 0) / n(), 
            draws = sum(hgoal == vgoal & hgoal + vgoal == 2) / n(), 
            nogoalht = sum(FHdif == 0) / n()) %>%
  mutate(boringness = (-1 * goal + 10 * nogoal + 7 * nogoalht + 5 * draws) / 10)%>%
  arrange(desc(boringness)) %>%
  slice(1:10) -> boring_season
  
```

> <p> 
  ggplot2:
</p>

```{r, message=FALSE}
boring_season$Season <- factor(boring_season$Season, levels=boring_season$Season[order(boring_season$boringness)])

##TODO FIX THIS

ggplot(data = boring_season, aes(x = Season)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = boringness, color = "Boringness(total)"), size = 2) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = boringness, color = "Boringness(total)"), group = 1, size = 2) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = goal / 10, color = "Goals")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = goal / 10, color = "Goals"), group = 1) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = nogoal, color = "0-0 Results")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = nogoal, color = "0-0 Results"), group = 1) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = draws, color = "1-1 Results")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = draws, color = "1-1 Results"), group = 1) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = nogoalht, color = "No Goals in Halftime")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = nogoalht, color = "No Goals in Halftime"), group = 1) + 
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
```

</p>

```{r}
boring_season %>%
  hchart(type = "column",
         hcaes(x = as.character(Season), y = round(boringness, 3)), 
         name = "Boringness", 
         dataLabels = list(enabled = T)) %>%
  hc_add_series(data = round(boring_season$nogoal, 2), name = "0-0 results", 
                dataLabels = list(enabled = T)) %>%

  hc_tooltip(valueDecimals = 3) %>%
  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_google())
```


### The Most Boring Teams

<p>
  I've summarised each team by these columns:
    1. mean of all the goals = A
    2. mean of all the games with no goals = B
    3. mean of all games with draw results = C
  Then I calculate boringness of each team by this equation:
  
  $$boringness = \frac{10 * B + 5 * C - A}{10}$$
  <br> <br> 
  
  
  
  
  Afterwards, I again sort the games in descending order based on this value.

            nogoal = sum(GF == 0) / n(), 
            draw = sum(GF == GA) / n())%>%
  mutate(boringness = (-1 * goal + 10 * nogoal + 5 * draw) /10) %>%

##Q3: How many times has the half season winner won the league?

<p >
  I've used the `laliga_halfseason` and `laliga_fullseason` data frames I've built in the beginning. From both data frames I've chosen the teams that have ranked first. Then I've used the `full_join()` function.
</p>

```{r, message = FALSE}
laliga_halfseason %>%
  filter(rank == 1) %>%
  select(Season, halfwinner = team) -> laliga_winner_hs

laliga_fullseason %>%
  filter(rank == 1) %>%
  select(Season, fullwinner = team) -> laliga_winner_fs

hs_vs_fs <- full_join(laliga_winner_hs, laliga_winner_fs)
```

> <p> 
  gplot2:
</p>

```{r}
ggplot(data = hs_vs_fs) + 
  geom_label(aes(x = halfwinner, y= fullwinner, 
                 fill = (halfwinner == fullwinner), 
                 label = Season), 
             size = 3, 
             label.r = unit(0, "lines"), 
             color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(labels = c("half season winner didn't win the league", 
                               "half season winner won the league"), 
                    values = c("TRUE"= "green", 
                               "FALSE"= "red")) +

<h2> 
&nbsp; Q4: Between the years 2001 and 2010, which teams were the "Black Cats" of big teams?
</h2>

<p >
  I've used the `laliga_fullseason` data frame and chosen the four teams with the most average number of championships.
</p>

```{r}
laliga_fullseason %>%
  filter(Season %in% seq(2001, 2010)) %>%
  group_by(team) %>%
  summarise(overallrank = mean(rank)) %>%
  arrange(overallrank) %>%
  slice(1:4) %>%
  select(team) %>%
  unlist() %>%
  unname() -> bigteams
```

<p >
  Again, I use the `laliga_fullseason` data frame and choose the teams which ranked in the last quarter. In a new column named `info`, I've kept the weakest teams and the season in which they were the weakest.
</p>

```{r}
laliga_fullseason %>%
  filter(Season %in% seq(2001, 2010)) %>%
  filter(rank > 3 * n() / 4) %>%
  select(Season, team) %>%
  mutate(info = paste(Season, team)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(info) %>%
  unlist() %>%
  unname() -> weekteams
```

<p >
  Then I've filtered the games in which these weak teams have won the big teams. 
</p>

```{r}
rbind(
  spain %>%
    select(Season, team = home, opp = visitor, GF = hgoal, GA = vgoal),
  spain %>%
    select(Season, team = visitor, opp = home, GF = vgoal, GA = hgoal)
) %>%
  filter(Season %in% seq(2001, 2010)) %>%
  mutate(info = paste(Season, team)) %>%
  filter(info %in% weekteams) %>%
  filter(opp %in% bigteams) %>%
  filter(GF > GA) -> blackcats

blackcats <- blackcats %>%
  select(-info)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(blackcats, captions = "Black Cats of Strong Teams")

<h2> 
&nbsp; Q5: Fastest championship? Best championship?
</h2>

<h3> 
&nbsp; Fastest championship
</h3>

<p>
  Again, I've used the `laliga_weekly` data frame. I add two new columns. In one I've calculated the difference between teams with successive ranks, and in the other the number of weeks left after each week(which is the number of remaining matches for each team). The I've chosen the teams that have ranked first with a score difference of more than 3 times the remaining games.
</p>

```{r}
laliga_weekly %>%
  mutate(scoredif = score - lead(score)) %>%
  arrange(Season, week, rank) %>%
  mutate(gamesleft = (teamnum - 1) * 2 - week) %>%
  filter(rank == 1) %>%
  filter(scoredif > gamesleft * 3) %>%
  select(Season, week, team, score, gamesleft) %>%
  group_by(Season) %>%
  filter(gamesleft == max(gamesleft)) %>%
  arrange(desc(gamesleft)) -> fastestwin

ggplot(data = fastestwinstat, aes(x = team, y = avg, color = team)) + 
  geom_point()+

<h3> 
&nbsp; Best championship
</h3>

<p>
  Using the `laliga_fullseason` data frame, I've added a new column calculating the difference between the scores of two successive teams. Then I've filtered the teams that have ranked first and sorted the data based on their score difference.
</p>

```{r}
laliga_fullseason %>%
  mutate(dif = abs(score - lead(score))) %>%

<h2> 
&nbsp; Q6: Longest winning/losing/draw streak?
</h2>

<p>
  I've used the `laliga_result` data frame and added two new columns two it. One states the result (Win, Draw or Lose), the other states the consecutive wins/draws/loses until then.
</p>

```{r}
laliga_result <- rbind(
  spain %>%
    select(Date, Season, team = home, opp = visitor, GF = hgoal, GA = vgoal),

  group_by(team) %>%
  arrange(team, Date)

laliga_result$streak <- sequence(rle(as.character(laliga_result$result))$lengths)

```

<h2> 
&nbsp; Q7: Fastest fall?
</h2>

<p>
  Once again, I've made the same changes as Question 5 to the `laliga_weekly` data frame. The teams I've chosen are the teams that have either ranked last, or fourth to last. 
  Again, I've used the `laliga_weekly` data frame. I add two new columns. In one I've calculated the difference between teams with successive ranks, and in the other the number of weeks left after each week(which is the number of remaining matches for each team). The I've chosen the teams that have ranked first with a score difference of more than 3 times the remaining games. Then I've thrown out the ones that have a score difference of less than 3 times the number of games left. Finally, I arranged the remaining teams in descending order based on the number of games left. (The team with the most number of games left has had the fastest lose in the history of LaLiga)
</p>

```{r}
laliga_weekly %>%
  filter(rank == teamnum | rank == teamnum - 3) %>%
  arrange(Season, week, rank) %>%
  mutate(scoredif = lag(score) - score, 
         gamesleft = (teamnum - 1) * 2 - week)  %>%
  select(Season, week, Date, team, score, rank, scoredif, teamnum, gamesleft) %>%
  arrange(Season, week) %>%
  filter(scoredif > gamesleft * 3) %>%
  group_by(Season) %>%
  filter(gamesleft == max(gamesleft)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(gamesleft)) %>%
  mutate(order = row_number(gamesleft)) -> fastestlose

fastestlose <- fastestlose[1:10, ]

```

```{r}

fastestlose$team <- factor(fastestlose$team, levels=fastestlose$team[order(fastestlose$gamesleft)])

<h2>
